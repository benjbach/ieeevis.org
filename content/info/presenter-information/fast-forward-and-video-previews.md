Please **read the following instructions carefully** and submit your
25-second video for the online Video Previews by **September 07, 2020**.

Video previews and fast forwards are a great opportunity to publicize
your work or event to a wide audience. Video previews are accessible
from the conference website on the VIS Vimeo channel prior to, during,
and after the conference. 


This year, due to IEEE VIS going fully virtual, video previews are linked 
from the conference's webpage and will be compiled into 'trailers', one for
each session. There will be no Fast-Forward session as in previous years. 


<!--
At least one author for each accepted
submission is required to present a 25-second preview of their work
during a Fast Forward (FF) session held at the conference. The same
25-second video supports both purposes: it will be archivally
available as a standalone video with audio track, and it will also be
played during the FF session **without** the audio track while the
author speaks. Voiceover narration in the audio track is strongly
recommended to make the archival video most useful, but is not
mandatory.

## Video Previews: 

- A video preview should be self-explaining and self-contained. 
- It should clearly communicate your research and contribution and invite readers to read your paper.
- Other than in recent years' Fast-Forwards sessions, we discourage humor and trailer-like 'ads'. 
- The video will exist for a long time and can be shared widely by the authors on social media and other channels. 
- It should contain narration. We discourage salient music to focus viewers attention on the content.
- Subtitles are mandatory to increase accessibility. See below for tips how to create and include subtitles

## Who has to submit a Video-Preview? 
If your track is not listed, please check for updates later as all track chairs are finalizing their decisions.

**Required:**
- SciVis Papers
- VizSec
- VISAP
- Short papers
- TVCG papers
- SIGGRAPH papers

**Optional:**
- InfoVis Papers
- VAST Papers
- SciVis Contest
- Posters

**No video-previews:**
- Tutorials
- VAST Challenge


## Technical and Legal Details: 

- Length: 25 seconds
- Maximum file size: 50MB
- Resolution: 1920 x 1080 px, at 30 frames/s
- Format: MPEG-4 using H.264 encoding (filename extension .mp4)
- **Media player:**
  - Video plays in the VLC media player version 2.2.4 (freely available at http://www.videolan.org/vlc) without additional software, codecs or settings
- **Audio:**
  - Should contain narration (supported by subtitles). 
  - We discourage salient music to focus viewers attention on the content.
  - If you want to music, you must certify that any audio is free from copyright or that you are licensed to use it.
- **Content:** 
  - does not include a title slide with the title of the work, authors, affiliations, etc. at the start of the video. We will add this to all videos in a consistent style.
- **Submission:**
  - videos will be uploaded **through the PCS author submission page of your accepted submission** (https://new.precisionconference.com/vgtc). You will find a new upload **field labelled Video-Preview upload**.  
  - submit your subtitles file (.srt) separately in the new field: **subtitles file**. Do not bake the subtitles into the video!
  - If your fast forward video is not for a paper and has no associated entry in the PCS system (e.g., TVCG CG&A papers), create a new Fast Forward video submission in the system. Please request a PCS login from the conference organizers if you do not have one.  
  - Name the video file <track name>-<ID>, where ID is the number automatically assigned when you first submitted your work on PCS (i.e., your paper ID). If your video does not have an accompanying PCS submission, use track name for the name of the event and ID for your last name.(e.g., vast_paper-100.mp4, meetups-guo.mp4)

Please **make sure that your video adheres to these specifications otherwise it will not be accepted** and will have to be reised.
